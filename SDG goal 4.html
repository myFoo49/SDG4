<h3 align="center"><font face="Bahnschrift" size="5" color="white">Goal 4 aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.
    This goal supports the reduction of disparities and inequities in education, both in terms of access and quality. 
    It recognizes the need to provide quality education for all, and most especially vulnerable populations, including poor children, children living in rural areas, 
    persons with disabilities, indigenous people and refugee children.</font></h3></h1></div></div>

<h4 align="center"><font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold" size="10" color="#c5192d">What are the current barriers in Quality Education?</font></h4>
<ol Type="1"><font face="Bahnschrift Light" size="5" color="white" >
<li><u>Harvest seasons and market days</u></li>
 In agricultural communities, the harvest is both a vital source of food and income. During these periods, children are often required
to skip school to help their families harvest and sell crops.
<br><br>
<li><u>Conflict and war</u></li>
Conflict may seem like an obvious barrier to education, but the scale of its impact is staggering.According to UNESCO, 
the first two years of the Syria crisis erased all the country's educational progress since the start of the 21st century.
<br><br>
<li><u>Climate change</u></li>
Climate change is one of the biggest threats to education. Extreme weather patterns are on the rise and can send vulnerable 
communities tumbling into poverty so they can't afford the fees and pulled their children out of school.
<br><br>
<li><u>Being Female</u></li>
One of the cruellest barriers to education is gender. In many countries around the world, girls are more likely to be excluded from education than boys. This is despite all the effort and progress made in recent years to increase the number of girls in school. 
According to UNESCO, up to 80% of school-aged girls who are currently out of school are unlikely to ever start. For boys currently out of school, the rate of never starting school is just 16%. 
<br><br>
<li><u>Cost of supplies and uniforms</u></li>
Parents and caretakers often pay for mandatory uniforms and other fees. School supplies are also necessary. According to a World Bank report, these costs can keep many students out of the classroom.
